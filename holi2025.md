- [Parasite: A Graphic Novel in Storyboards](https://academymuseumstore.org/products/parasite-a-graphic-novel-in-storyboards) -- i've been learning a little bit of filming / cinematography for work and storyboarding is my weakspot. i just want to improvise, but that doesn't always work out :sweat_smile:. this seems like a fantastic resource!!
- [Muji pens in 0.38mm](https://www.muji.us/collections/pen-sets/products/gel-ink-cap-type-ballpoint-pen-10-color-set?variant=41536560300222) -- an absolute classic
- [Madhur Jaffrey's Ultimate Curry Bible](https://www.abebooks.com/book-search/isbn/9780091874155/n/100121502) -- idk if i'll ever be over cooking Indian food :)
- [Act+Acre hair towel](https://www.dermstore.com/p/act-acre-microfiber-hair-towel/13926907/) -- these actually do work lol
- [Senga Nengudi: Populated Air](https://shop.diaart.org/product/senga-nengudi-populated-air/VEKEUXJO2IJAISFA5QRLGXAC) -- i saw her work at Dia Beacon last year (like 202*4*) and i haven't stopped thinking about her. every time i look at common space or objects, i wonder how much art is embedded, if i just gave it all attention.
- [Shapeshifter by Alice Paalen Rahon](https://www.nyrb.com/products/shapeshifter?_pos=1&_sid=6cc47dba9&_ss=r&variant=32573215244425) -- surrealist visions, color and light that i'd like to experience.
