when i was 8, i met my half-sister as a newborn in a stroller, shortly after my parents started their divorce proceedings. my mom and i had run into her mom and our dad at a local fair, by the strongman game. i had seen a lot of violence between my parents and as my dad told me 'this is your sister', it was strange to feel sadness at the idea of new life being brought into what we'd all been through together while also feeling excitement at the possibility that this new life could signal an end to it.
 
as i grew up, i often wondered about her but my mom clung to the narrative that this door was best left closed. i held private hope that as i got older, i'd find a way to be a part of her life. as i entered adulthood, though, i was pretty unmoored and didn't feel like our connection would be of any benefit to her -- i had also begun a process of disentangling myself from the family i *did* grow up with, and the idea of seeking more connections seemed, at best, irresponsible. so, about a decade ago, i simply released the idea that we'd ever know each other and, given our shared history, this was likely for the best.
 
fast-forward to last july. as part of a semi-annual 'i wonder if...' search, she'd found [sound + process](https://soundcloud.com/sound-and-process) and, at the encouragement of her younger half-brother from her mother's next marriage, reached out to me the only way she could manage to find: through direct message at lines.
 
unfortunately, i panicked and shut down -- i told her i wasn't interested in personally connecting and didn't respond to her follow-up messages. that weekend, i asked everyone i knew with siblings whether, ignoring the bonds forged from shared childhood experiences, they'd choose their relationship to them *now*. responses were mixed, but confirmed that the best relationships (blood or otherwise) are often born of consistent and mutual choice. both answers described the same type of work that relationships between adults require -- the only difference between the affirmations and declinations was whether that work was currently happening.

so, on a long train ride between north carolina and new york, i wrote her an email apologizing for the way i met her open-heartedness, shared some of the reasons behind it, and opened the door.
 
over the course of a lot of long phone calls, she helped me excavate the space into which i had rationed fear for 26 years. it filled with ease, care, and love -- not because i had hoped these feelings into existence, but because they were being being openly and plainly offered. and last november, i got to meet her and the family she's starting.

in may, i was lucky to submit a video to the https://llllllll.co/t/cached-media-season-2-showcase-may-26-27-twitch/55460, celebrating a triptych of releases from so many artists i deeply admire. my portion was an improvisation with a soon-to-be-released norns script, `hills`:

though the developments described above weren't top of mind during play, they *are* part of my being, so i've gone through and edited my audio into an EP called 'mirrored heart' which is named for my experience of recognizing what's shared between two fundamentally different people who happen to share a few facts.
 
i'll be donating any proceeds to try and help my half-sister's family, which i'm grateful to call my family, navigate a recent bout of housing + employment troubles. i'm hoping to gather a bit of a solid foundation for her, her partner, and the kiddos, so that they can begin building a life beyond their circumstances. also, if there's any desire to give directly, [here's a link to my paypal](https://paypal.me/soundandprocess).
