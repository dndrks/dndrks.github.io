## Digital Synthesis Workshop @ the Firehouse

[Rylee Lyman](https://ryleealanza.org/) and I will lead participants through the fundamentals of making and shaping sound through [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/), a free software modular synthesizer. We’ll cover the basics of the program’s interface, dig into signal flow and mixing, and explore techniques for creating modulation and changing timbre. This workshop is perfect for those curious about modular synthesis, digital music making, and sound design.
