[Basic Synthesis](https://luckdragon.space/event/synthesis.html): Friday April 14, 6-8:30pm at Luck Dragon (100 Main St, Delhi, NY 13753)  

This class is designed for *total beginners*! Come learn the fundamentals of making and shaping sound through VCV Rack, a free software modular synthesizer. We’ll cover the basics of synthesizers, experiment with combining simple sounds to create compelling tones, and become familiar with the program’s interface for continuing the adventures at home! Perfect for those curious about modular synthesis, digital music making, and sound design.
