featuring:

- [A. Campbell Payne](https://acampbellpayne.com/): a performer and composer based in Boston who creates dance and ambient music that explores the concepts of pattern, chance, repetition, recursion, time, and community.
- [Alanza](https://alanza.bandcamp.com/): a polymath living in Brooklyn, NY. Musically, they are interested in form, timbre and a good riff. Lately they are trying to strike a balance between the composed and the improvised, the sequenced and the performed.

They build code through improvisation, creating their own environments for playful and exploratory music performance gestures.
