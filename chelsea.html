<br/><h2>some history</h2>
<p>when i was 8, i met my half-sister as a newborn in a stroller, shortly after my parents started their divorce proceedings. my mom and i ran into my dad with his new family at a local fair, by the strongman game.</p>
<p>by this point, i had seen a lot of violence between my parents -- and as my dad said 'Danny, this is your sister, Chelsea', it was strange to feel both sadness at the idea of new life being brought into what we'd all experienced together, and excitement at the possibility that her arrival might signal an end to it.</p>
<p>unfortunately, things unfolded along the former trajectory. as i grew up, i often wondered about Chelsea but my mom clung to the narrative that this door should be left closed. still, i held private hope that i'd find a way to be a part of her life as i got older. when i entered adulthood, though, i was pretty unmoored and didn't feel like our connection could be of any benefit to her -- i had also begun a process of disentangling myself from the family i <em>did</em> grow up with, and the idea of seeking more familial connections seemed like it'd just be messy.</p>
<p>so, about a decade ago, i released the idea that we'd ever know each other -- given our shared history, this was likely for the best.</p>
<h2>fast-forward to july 2021</h2>
<p>as part of a semi-annual 'i wonder if...' search online, Chelsea found <a href="https://soundcloud.com/sound-and-process">sound + process</a> and, at the encouragement of her younger half-brother from her mother's next marriage, reached out to me via <a href="https://llllllll.co">lines</a>.</p>
<p>i panicked and shut down -- i told her i wasn't interested in personally connecting and didn't respond to her follow-up messages. that weekend, i asked everyone i knew with siblings whether, ignoring the bonds forged from shared childhood experiences, they'd choose them <em>now</em>. responses were mixed, but confirmed that the best relationships (blood or otherwise) are often rooted in consistent and mutual choice. every answer identified the same work that all relationships require, the only difference between the affirmations and declinations was whether that work was currently happening.</p>
<p>so, on a long train ride between north carolina and new york, i wrote her an email apologizing for the way i met her bravery + clear-heartedness, shared some of the reasons behind it, and opened the door.</p>
<p>over the course of a lot of long phone calls, Chelsea helped me excavate the space which i had poured fear into for 26 years. through her honesty and willingness to take things as they went, we were able backfill it with ease, care, and love.</p>
<p>and in November of 2021, i got to meet her and the family she's starting:</p>
<p><img src="/images/chelsea.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2>an ask for assistance (2023)</h2>
<p>In August 2023, Chelsea and her family were served an eviction notice from their landlord -- though nonpayment was cited as the reason, this does not capture the complexity of the situation.</p>
<p>When she realized that she'd be unable to pay her rent, Chelsea had proactively secured approval for RAFT (Residential Assistance for Families in Transition), a program which is designed to provide short-term financial assistance to low-income families in Massachusetts. Dispersement of these funds takes time, however -- so she has been paying her landlord what she can in cash for the past few weeks, often without receiving the receipts promised in return, under the assumption that RAFT will deliver back-payment. But since the RAFT benefit period has not yet technically started, and because her family's tenancy is at-will, Chelsea's landlord faces no restrictions on serving an eviction -- this is further compounded by the reality of low-income housing, where a landlord can claim any number of lease agreement violations without agency involvement / verification. And legal action requires free time, which is simply not a possibility for two people who work overnight shifts and gig economy jobs for $20/hr.</p>
<p>As of this writing, Chelsea, her partner George, and their two kids are now at the end of the 14 day Notice to Quit served to them by the sheriff. They are quite literally living on borrowed time and are facing the potential of becoming homeless.</p>
<p>For those fortunate to have grown up without much dependence on state or local programs, or even marginally above the poverty line, how somebody gets 'into' (and 'out of') this type of situation can seem rather cut-and-dry. But, to put it plainly, being poor is incredibly expensive. The day-to-day reality is deeply complicated and requires a bonkers level of self-driven case management. For example, there is no single source of assistance -- you are in charge of managing the differing monthly requirements for a dozen different programs which are each silo'd across your basic needs (eg. food, healthcare, childcare, housing). But, at the same time, there <em>is</em> a web of interdependency between these programs which limits the amount of help you receive across all of them. For example, raising her children in the same household as their other parent actually <em>reduces</em> the family's monthly food stamp allotment. And this isn't just a &quot;use the cash from his Door Dash shifts to buy groceries, then&quot; situation -- food stamps provide access to higher quality food for her kids than walking into a store with cash in-hand would ever allow.</p>
<p>In short, every day is a balancing act of choosing between which one (like, which <em>single</em> one) of her family's needs will be met, and hoping that the timing works out so she can (best case scenario) make that difficult choice again tomorrow.</p>
<p>Chelsea is an incredible human being who has worked tirelessly to survive, fueled by the belief that her circumstances did not define her. In many ways, she has manifested this truth again and again. I don't know whether this is useful or necessary to state, but she has no history of substance abuse (it was her mom's own dependencies which forced her to leave home when she was 14), she has no criminal record, she is simply caught in a web of social support blind-spots.</p>
<p>Nobody knows what the next few weeks will look like for her and her family, but if you're able to donate to our PayPal fundraiser, they'll at least have some options. This is a very difficult situation to parse, so I hope the above all read legibly. Regardless of your ability to donate, I appreciate you reading and keeping Chelsea and her family in mind &lt;333</p>
<h2>an ask for assistance (2022)</h2>
<p>i'd like to help Chelsea and her partner navigate a recent bout of housing + employment troubles. i'm hoping to gather a bit of a solid foundation for them, so that they can begin building a life beyond their circumstances as a low-income, multiracial family. this includes enrolling in continuing education (her partner is looking to get his GED and Chelsea's pursuing nursing licensure + returning to college), being able to reduce their gig-economy work hours to actually apply for / interview for higher-paying + stable roles, fixing their car from a recent drive by-shooting while on a DoorDash run (thankfully, the kids were not in the car and neither Chelsea or her partner were hurt), and taking care of the past due bills which have piled up as they traversed a months-long runaround from housing authorities in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>to donate, please visit <strong><a href="https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8Pq78ikUnZ">our PayPal fundraiser</a></strong>. everything will go to Chelsea + her family directly -- i'm only organizing to hopefully cast a wide net.</p>
<p>i'm so grateful for the time you've taken to read this + hope that the year is closing well for you &lt;3</p>
<p>best,<br />
